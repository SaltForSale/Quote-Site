      <h3>Quotes from Mr. Kilgore</h3>

        Honestly I thought he would have more funny things but I was too lazy to
        actually remember funny stuff so I just took things I thought were funny
        from classroom announcements.

        I just wanted to say that I know this
        <span class="accent">JavaScript</span> stuff is hard but you are ALL
        doing a really great job with it and I PROMISE YOU, if you keep at it,
        keep trying and keep practicing it will get easy for you. No one went
        from being born to running marathons, we just learned how to stand up
        <span class="accent">HTML/CSS</span> and now were learning how to walk,
        except to stumble and fall down, A LOT! , but keep getting back up and
        trying again!
