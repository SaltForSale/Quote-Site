      <h3>My Colored Pictures </h3>
      <p>This isn't going to be some sob story, so I'm going to tell you where I got these scuffed pictures of these colors. It isn't rocket science. Me, Ryan, and Evan walked around the school and took 50 weird pictures of random colors hoping for it to fit the topic. And it worked because it is on this website</p>
      <p>I spent 2 hours just to get some text to glow a different color - Ryan </p>
